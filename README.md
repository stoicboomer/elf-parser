# elf-parser
An elf-parser written in C++
I'm writing this to understand more about how a binary is strctured 
and executed, pretty good journey so far. It's still incomplete.
I added some useful comments on elfparse.h if you want to try
the methods yourself.

###TODO
- [*] Elf header parse
- [*] Program headers parse
- [*] Section headers parse
- [*] Strings dump
- [ ] Symbols parse
- [ ] Relocations parse
